# brain — Second-Brain Plugin for Claude Code

> PARA + Zettelkasten second-brain integration. Capture session context as you work and flush it to a structured Obsidian vault — without ever letting Claude touch your git history.

`brain` turns Claude Code into a capture-first knowledge worker. While you code, it tracks decisions, bugs fixed, patterns discovered, TILs, snippets, and open questions in memory. When you're ready, `/brain save` flushes everything to your vault as daily notes, debugging logs, ADR candidates, area changelogs, and permanent notes — already-classified and pre-formatted.

The vault is yours. The plugin only stages writes. You commit on your own schedule.

## Objectives

- **💸 Save Claude tokens.** Vault-first lookup pulls answers from your own notes (`05-notes/permanent/`, `10-snippets/`, `11-debugging/`) before falling back to the model. 200 tokens of your compressed notes beats 2000 tokens of regenerated answer. Your vault becomes a personal knowledge cache that pays back every session.
- **🧠 Update your Obsidian brain alongside coding work.** No context-switch to a separate note app. Capture decisions, bugs, and snippets while you're in flow; flush to the vault with one command (`/brain:brain save`) when you're done.
- **📝 Stay in capture-first mode.** The plugin holds session context in memory and writes nothing until you say so. No surprise edits, no half-baked notes scattered around.
- **🗂️ Enforce structure without thinking about it.** PARA folders, Zettelkasten permanent notes, ADRs, debugging logs, area changelogs — all routed automatically based on what you captured. You write content; the plugin handles filing.
- **🔒 Never touch your git history.** Staging via `Edit`/`Write` only. The plugin never runs `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push` in the vault. You commit when you're ready to.
- **🔁 Cross-session memory.** What you capture today shows up as a citation in next week's answer. The vault grows; future-you benefits.

## Install

```text
/plugin marketplace add aegis-imm/brain
/plugin install brain@brain-marketplace
```

Then restart Claude Code (or run `/reload-plugins`).

## First run

**Step 1 — Initialize the vault.** Run `/brain init` once to point the plugin at your Obsidian vault and scaffold the PARA structure:

```text
/brain:brain init
```

You'll be asked where the vault should live. Default is `~/brain`; pick anything you want (e.g. an existing Obsidian vault path). The chosen path is saved to `~/.brainrc.json` so future sessions remember it.

To pin the vault path via environment instead, set it before running init:

```bash
export BRAIN_VAULT="$HOME/Documents/obsidian/brain"
```

Init creates 15 PARA folders, copies 9 templates into `08-templates/`, and seeds `99-meta/system-rules.md` (tag taxonomy, naming conventions, weekly review checklist).

**Step 2 — (Optional) Initialize git in the vault** so you have history:

```bash
cd "$BRAIN_VAULT" && git init
```

**Step 3 — Use any other `/brain` subcommand.** If you skipped step 1, the plugin will refuse and offer a one-tap fix:

> *"🧠 No brain vault configured. Run `/brain init` now? (y/n)"*

Answer `y` and the original subcommand resumes after init.

**Step 4 — Start a session.** On the first message of any project, the plugin asks:

> 🧠 Brain detected at `<vault-path>`. Log this session? (yes / no / later)

Reply `yes` to start tracking. Work normally. When done:

```text
/brain:brain save
```

## Command reference

> Plugin commands are namespaced. The slash command is `/brain:brain <subcommand>`.

| Subcommand | What it does |
|---|---|
| `init` | Scaffold PARA folders + copy templates + seed `system-rules.md` |
| `on` | Start tracking the current session |
| `off` / `skip` | Stop tracking and discard the in-memory session log |
| `status` | Print the in-memory buckets as a markdown preview (no writes) |
| `save` | Flush session log to the vault: daily note + changelogs + debugging logs + snippets |
| `note <text>` | Append `<text>` to the appropriate bucket (auto-classified) |
| `adr` | Create `12-adr/adr-NNN-<slug>.md` from the latest load-bearing decision |
| `meeting <topic>` | File a meeting note under the current area |
| `interview <stakeholder>` | File a requirements interview note (mom-test discipline) |
| `1on1 <name>` | File a 1:1 note under the current area's `1on1/` folder |
| `quiet` | Suppress vault-first lookup for the rest of the session |
| `search <query>` | Direct vault search via the index — top 5 cited matches |
| `promote <source>` | Promote a daily-note line or phrase into `05-notes/permanent/<slug>.md` |
| `stats` | Vault health dashboard: counts, pipeline, areas, growth |
| `reindex` | Rebuild `<vault>/99-meta/vault-index.json` from scratch |

## Vault index (perf cache)

The plugin maintains `<vault>/99-meta/vault-index.json` — a flat JSON cache of every note's path, title, tags, and first line. Vault-first lookup reads this once instead of grepping hundreds of files per query.

- **Built by:** `/brain:brain reindex` (manual) and auto-appended on every `/brain:brain save`.
- **Skipped folders:** `00-inbox/`, `04-archive/`, `08-templates/`, `99-meta/`.
- **Stale detection:** if the vault directory `mtime` is newer than the index, you'll see a one-line nudge to reindex. Lookup still works on the stale index — no block.

## Vault-first lookup (token-saver)

When you ask a technical question (rust, axum, oracle, debugging, etc.), the plugin searches your vault **before** answering from model knowledge:

1. Greps `05-notes/permanent/`, `10-snippets/<lang>/`, `11-debugging/`, `02-areas/*/<area>-patterns.md`, `12-adr/`
2. If matches → leads the answer with your own notes, cites the file path
3. If no matches → answers normally and offers to capture the answer with `/brain:brain note`

**Why:** vault notes are already compressed by you. Pulling 200 tokens of your own notes beats 2000 tokens of model regen. Over time, your vault becomes a personal knowledge cache.

To suppress lookup for a session: `/brain:brain quiet`.

## What gets captured

While `BRAIN=on`, the plugin tracks (in memory only — nothing is written until `/brain:brain save`):

| Bucket | Examples |
|---|---|
| `project` | basename of cwd, brief one-line goal of this session |
| `work_done` | files touched, features added, refactors, PRs opened |
| `decisions` | architectural / technical choices worth recording |
| `bugs_fixed` | symptom → root cause → fix → prevention |
| `patterns` | reusable techniques |
| `tils` | one-line "today I learned" items |
| `snippets` | small reusable code blocks |
| `open_questions` | unresolved items |

## Tag taxonomy

All tags are namespaced. No bare tags (`#rust` → `#lang/rust`). Max ~5 tags per note.

| Namespace | Examples | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `#status/` | `draft`, `active`, `done`, `archived` | Lifecycle |
| `#type/` | `note`, `permanent`, `meeting`, `1on1`, `adr`, `debugging`, `snippet`, `daily`, `project` | Note kind |
| `#lang/` | `rust`, `typescript`, `python`, `go`, `sql` | Programming language |
| `#domain/` | `auth`, `payments`, `infra`, `frontend` | Subject domain |
| `#difficulty/` | `easy`, `medium`, `hard` | Effort required |
| `#area/` | `<area-slug>` | Cross-link to a `02-areas/` folder |
| `#fw/` | `react`, `axum`, `nextjs`, `django` | Framework |

Edit `<vault>/99-meta/system-rules.md` to extend or change the taxonomy.

## Hard rules (the plugin will never break these)

1. **Never writes to the vault** unless `BRAIN=on` AND you've typed `/brain:brain save` (or confirmed at session end).
2. **Never runs `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push`** in the vault. Staging via `Edit`/`Write` only — you commit manually.
3. **Never deletes vault files** without explicit per-file confirmation.
4. **Never modifies** `99-meta/system-rules.md`, `99-meta/migration-*.md`, or vault `README.md` unless explicitly asked.
5. **Project-local `CLAUDE.md` always wins** if it conflicts with the brain skill.

## Configuration

| Source | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `$BRAIN_VAULT` env var | — | Highest priority. Set in your shell rc to pin a vault path across sessions. |
| `~/.brainrc.json` | — | Written by the init wizard: `{ "vault": "<absolute-path>" }`. Skip the prompt next time. |
| Built-in default | `~/brain` | Used only if neither of the above is set. |

## Customizing templates

The templates copied by `/brain:brain init` live in your vault at `08-templates/`. Edit them freely — the plugin reads the vault copies, not the bundled originals, when filing new notes.

To re-seed templates from the plugin (e.g. after updating the plugin), delete the file in `08-templates/` and run `/brain:brain init` again — it skips files that already exist.
